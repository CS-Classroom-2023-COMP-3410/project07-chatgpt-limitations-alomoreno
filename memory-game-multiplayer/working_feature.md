I was able to add the multiplayer use (only up to 2 players), with the special feature where if the player gets a match they get another turn. There were a few challenges with chatgpt but I found it is wasier to use when using chunks of features and adding to the already existing code. The only thing I would consider changing is that the total moves collects the moves of both players, when it would be better to seperate the number of moves between players.
